                We use ads to monetize the App. As a partner we selected  Unity Ads as an  institution in that area with high standards for safety and compliance to local regulations. We integrated the UnityAds-SDK and by this the App the following information might be shared with Unity and Partners:
                <ul>
                <li>IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.</li>
                <li>Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.</li>
                <li>User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.</li>
                <li>A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.</li>
                <li>Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.</li>
                <li>Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance 
                    For more details read Data Disclosure and Unity Ads.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Game Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App may allow you to access common game services on your device. If you decide to make use of them their privacy policy applies.
                <ul>
                    <li>Only when downloaded from Google Play Store: Google Play Services</li>
                    <li>Only when downloaded from Apple Appstore: Apple Game Center</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <h2>Other Data</h2>
            <p>
                When you download the App from an Appstore or perform an inApp purchase you enter a contract with the Appstore owner. As an app developer we do not have access to any of your payment or contract data. The store provider is responsible for that and you agree to their terms & conditions and privacy policy.

                The App may only be usable in combination with the Appstore installed on your device. The App uses the store APIs to enable the App to provide features like inApp purchase. Those privacy aspects are covered by the store's privacy & terms that you needed to accept before download the App.

                Personal data are treated as strictly confidential and are not divulged to third parties without the Userâ€™s consent unless this is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the game service, optimizing the game, processing enquiries or customer care. The data may also be disclosed if its disclosure is required by law.
